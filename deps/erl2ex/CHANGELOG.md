# Changelog

Erl2ex is currently pre-alpha software. Expect significant backwards-incompatible changes for the time being.

## v0.0.9 (2016-04-11)

*   Created a structure representing the results and status of a conversion, and reworked the main entry point functions to use it.
*   Allow specification of the directory for application dependencies (i.e. where to look for include_lib files.)
*   Simple macros can now appear in typespecs and record fields (but not yet the record name). The transpiler substitutes the replacement value because Elixir syntax can't handle a macro call at those locations.
*   Rename specs when the transpiler renames the associated function.
*   Reworked conversion of public functions whose names can't be deffed directly, to use a simpler technique that now also works for "unquote".
*   Calls to remote functions with names that can't be referenced directly (like "1func" or "unquote") failed. Fixed using Kernel.apply.
*   Reworked conversion of "if" statements so it supports expressions that cause errors.
*   Add "when" to the list of reserved names.
*   The Erlang is_record BIF is now mapped to the Elixir Record.is_record macro so it's compatible with Elixir-defined records.

## v0.0.8 (2016-02-25)

*   Factored out source and sink processes, to make testing easier and secondary jobs cleaner.
*   Perform `epp_dodger` parsing in addition to `erl_parse`. We're not taking full advantage of this yet, but it should eventually help preserve comments better, as well as handle some more preprocessor edge cases.
*   REGRESSION: preservation of module and form comments is currently broken as a result of the above. This will be fixed in a subsequent version.
*   Refactored and rearranged the internal pipeline modules.
*   Support full bitstring modifier syntax.
*   Support comprehensions whose first qualifier isn't a generator. (Thanks to eproxus for the tip.)
*   If an operator is translated to an Elixir BIF with the same name as an exported function, it is now properly qualified.
*   Better analysis to determine when variables in arguments passed to macros should be exported.
*   Unhygenize variables created in macro body, to match Erlang macro behavior.
*   Ensure all variables in specs are called out in constraints as required by Elixir.
*   Recognize type info in record declarations, and emit them with record types.
*   Variables passed to size() in a binary pattern match incorrectly had a caret. Fixed.
*   A -file attribute no longer converts directly to Elixir (which would break compilation).
*   Better error reporting when an included file could not be found.

## v0.0.7 (2016-01-25)

*   Overhauled the logic that reconciled imported vs defined functions, and fixed some related issues. Calls of functions with conflicting names are now properly qualified.
*   Allow definition and calling of exported functions with names that the parser won't normally accept; e.g. Elixir keywords such as "do", or names with strange characters such as "E=mc^2".
*   Support invoking a constant macro as a function name.
*   If a function's argument pattern looks like a keyword block, it tried to codegen as such. Fixed.
*   If an Erlang variable name was a capitalized version of an Elixir keyword (such as "End"), it would generate uncompilable Elixir code. Fixed.
*   If the input did not end with a newline, the final form was dropped. Fixed.
*   The "??" stringification preprocessor syntax generated binaries rather than char lists. Fixed.
*   Created a mechanism to compile and run the generated code in unit tests, and started modifying a subset of the tests to use it.
*   Started some optional end-to-end tests that convert and run against common Erlang libraries.
*   Refactor: Break analysis out into a separate stage instead of combining with conversion context.

## v0.0.6 (2016-01-19)

*   Unicode characters greater than 127 were incorrectly encoded in output files, and codepoints greater than 255 caused codegen to crash. Fixed.
*   Convert string() and nonempty_string() Erlang types to the preferred Elixir equivalents, to avoid an Elixir warning.
*   Support for environment variable interpolation in include paths.
*   Support for redefining macros.
*   Support for macro definitions that include comma and semicolon delimited expressions.
*   Generate macros for record_info calls and record index expressions.
*   Erlang characters (e.g. $A) are translated into the Elixir equivalent syntax (e.g. ?A) rather than integers.

## v0.0.5 (2016-01-11)

*   All Erlang macros now translate to Elixir macros, since it seems to be possible for parameterless macros not to be simple values.
*   Variable names could clash with a BIF referenced in another function. Fixed.

## v0.0.4 (2016-01-05)

*   Generate file comments by default.
*   When a comment begins with multiple percent signs, convert all of them to hashes.
*   Separate clauses within a case, receive, or catch leaked variable scopes to each other. Fixed.
*   Support remote function calls with an expression as the function name.
*   Evaluate record_info calls directly since creating a function doesn't seem to work.
*   Ensure "defined_*" attributes are initialized if the erlang source doesn't define them explicitly.
*   Allow definition of constant macros from environment variables or application configs.

## v0.0.3 (2016-01-03)

*   Requires Elixir 1.2. Updated the source for 1.2 warnings and deprecations.
*   Updated and cleaned up ExDoc documentation.
*   Support include_lib directive.
*   Generate comments around each inline included file.
*   Repeated matches on the same variable weren't properly annotated with a caret. Fixed.
*   Funs with no parameters incorrectly translated to a single nil parameter. Fixed.
*   Variable name mangling did not preserve leading underscores. Fixed.

## v0.0.2 (2015-12-31)

*   Better reporting of parse and conversion errors.
*   Support for custom and remote types.
*   Support for the after-clause of receive.
*   Ifdef/ifndef/undef didn't handle capitalized macro names. Fixed.
*   Catch assumed the kind was an atom and didn't accept an expression. Fixed.
*   Recognize bitstring elements with an explicit value, explicit size, and binary type.

## v0.0.1 (2015-12-28)

*   Initial release to hex.
